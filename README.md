Bark Nark is a Raspberry Pi controlled system to allow passerbys and neighbors in an apartment balcony setting to text a command triggering mists if your dog is barking, or treats if she is being good. 
A large television screen will display the phone number to text, along with the commands. The texting aspect will be handled by twilio. Concept photo attached.

## Requirements
Raspberry Pi with a few servos, camera, and some type of monitor/tv to display phone number, text commands, and usage stat.

Twilio(for SMS handling)
Flask(receiving SMS via webhook)
RPi.GPIO


## Usage
Passive dog training using your neighbors to help train your dog in an apartment setting.
